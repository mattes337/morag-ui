## Pending Tasks

### Vision Implementation
- ðŸ“‹ **Vision Analysis Complete**: Comprehensive analysis of VISION.md requirements completed
  - Created detailed task breakdown in `tasks/vision/` folder
  - Identified 4 major phases with 12+ specific implementation tasks
  - **Corrected Understanding**: Realm-level prompts are correctly implemented, focus on domain configuration
  - **Corrected Architecture**: MoRAG backend handles database operations, UI backend handles metadata
  - **Priority**: Document deletion moved to high priority, blog authoring to medium priority
  - **Next Action**: Begin with Task 1.1 (Realm Domain Configuration) and Task 1.2 (MoRAG API)
  - **See**: [Vision Implementation Overview](./tasks/vision/README.md)

## Implementation Plan
### 1. API Endpoints Implementation
- Document required endpoints in ENDPOINTS.md
- Create /app/api/servers directory
- Implement server API endpoints:
  - GET /api/servers - List all servers for authenticated user
  - POST /api/servers - Create new server
  - GET /api/servers/[id] - Get specific server
  - PUT /api/servers/[id] - Update server
  - DELETE /api/servers/[id] - Delete server
### 2. Service Layer Implementation
- Enhance databaseServerService.ts with CRUD operations
- Add proper validation for server creation/updates
- Implement authentication checks
- Add error handling for all operations
### 3. Frontend Integration
- Update ServersDialog.tsx to use API endpoints instead of local state
- Update app/servers/page.tsx to use API endpoints
- Modify AppContext.tsx to fetch servers from API
- Update server management functions to use API calls
### 4. Testing
- Create unit tests for server API endpoints
- Test database creation with valid serverId
- Test error handling for invalid serverIds
- Verify UI components correctly display server data
## Technical Specifications
### Database Server Model (synonym: Database)
```
interfaceÂ DatabaseServerÂ {
Â Â id:Â string;
Â Â name:Â string;
Â Â type:Â 'qdrant'Â |Â 'neo4j'Â |Â 'pinecone'Â |Â

## Next Steps
To resolve the foreign key constraint error, we need to implement the server API endpoints first, then update the frontend components to use these endpoints instead of local state management.

Once implemented, users will be able to create and manage database servers through the API, which will then be available for selection when creating databases.

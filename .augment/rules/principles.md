Always architecture code using the core principles:

*   **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself):** This principle emphasizes avoiding duplication of code. Every piece of knowledge or logic should have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system.
*   **SoC (Separation of Concerns):** This principle suggests that a computer program should be decomposed into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern. This makes the program easier to develop and maintain.
*   **KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid):** This principle states that most systems work best if they are kept simple rather than made complicated; therefore, simplicity should be a key goal in design, and unnecessary complexity should be avoided.
*   **YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It):** This principle states that a programmer should not add functionality until it is actually needed. It's a tenet of extreme programming that helps reduce unnecessary code and complexity.
*   **SOLID:** This is an acronym for five design principles intended to make software designs more understandable, flexible, and maintainable.
    *   **S - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP):** A class should have only one reason to change.
    *   **O - Open/Closed Principle (OCP):** Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
    *   **L - Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP):** Objects in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
    *   **I - Interface Segregation Principle (ISP):** Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
    *   **D - Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP):** High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Abstractions should not depend on details. Details should depend on abstractions.
*   **Principle of Least Astonishment (POLA):** A system should behave in a way that is consistent with users' expectations, minimizing surprises.
*   **Composition Over Inheritance:** This principle suggests that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and reuse of code by containing instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality rather than by inheriting from them.

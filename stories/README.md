## üöÄ How to Use

### Running Storybook
```bash
npm run storybook
```

### Testing Interactive Features

#### Stage Processing Simulation
1. Navigate to `Components/StageControlPanel/Interactive Simulation`
2. Click "Execute" on MARKDOWN_CONVERSION to start
3. Watch the 2-second simulation with progress updates
4. Use "Execute Chain" to run all remaining stages
5. Try "Reset to Stage" to reset progress
6. Toggle between MANUAL and AUTOMATIC modes

#### Full Application Flow
1. Navigate to `App/Full Application Simulation`
2. Start with realm selection (mock admin realm available)
3. Click on a realm to view documents
4. Click on a document to view details
5. Use the processing controls to simulate stage execution
6. Watch the debug panel for state changes

## üîß Technical Implementation

### Mock Data
- **Realms**: Admin realm (morag.drydev.de) with proper user roles
- **Documents**: 8 sample documents in various processing states
- **Stages**: Complete stage configuration with all possible states

### Simulation Features
- **Async Operations**: Proper async/await for realistic timing
- **State Management**: React hooks for state transitions
- **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates (0-100%)
- **Error Simulation**: Random failures and recovery scenarios

### Layout Fixes

- **Vertical Text**: CSS transform for 90-degree rotation
- **Current Stage**: Full card display for active stage

## üêõ Issues Addressed

### ‚úÖ Past/Future Stages Display
- **Problem**: Stages were displayed in grid columns
- **Solution**: Horizontal layout with compact vertical columns
- **Implementation**: CSS transforms for text rotation

### ‚úÖ No Realms Displayed for Admin
- **Problem**: Empty realm list in Storybook
- **Solution**: Mock admin realm data with proper configuration
- **Implementation**: Comprehensive mock data in stories

### ‚úÖ No Documents Displayed
- **Problem**: Empty document list
- **Solution**: Mock document data with various states
- **Implementation**: 8 sample documents with realistic data

### ‚úÖ Event Handling Simulation
- **Problem**: No interactive stage execution
- **Solution**: Complete simulation with 2s delays and progress
- **Implementation**: Async functions with state updates

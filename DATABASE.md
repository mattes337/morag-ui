## Enums

### UserRole
Defines user permission levels:
- `ADMIN`: Full system access, can manage all users and resources
- `USER`: Standard user with access to own resources
- `VIEWER`: Read-only access to assigned resources

### Theme
UI theme preferences:
- `LIGHT`: Light theme
- `DARK`: Dark theme
- `SYSTEM`: Follow system theme preference

### DocumentState
Document processing lifecycle states:
- `PENDING`: Document uploaded but not yet processed
- `INGESTING`: Document is currently being processed
- `INGESTED`: Document successfully processed and stored
- `DEPRECATED`: Document marked as outdated
- `DELETED`: Document marked for deletion

### DatabaseType
Supported vector database types:
- `QDRANT`: Qdrant vector database
- `NEO4J`: Neo4j graph database
- `PINECONE`: Pinecone vector database
- `WEAVIATE`: Weaviate vector database
- `CHROMA`: ChromaDB vector database

### JobStatus
Job processing states:
- `PENDING`: Job created but not started

## Indexes and Constraints

### Primary Keys
All entities use UUID-based primary keys for better distribution and security.

### Unique Constraints
- `User.email`: Ensures unique user identification
- `ApiKey.key`: Prevents duplicate API keys
- `Database(name, userId)`: Users cannot have databases with duplicate names
- `UserSettings.userId`: One settings record per user

### Foreign Key Constraints
All relationships use CASCADE or SET NULL deletion policies:
- User deletion cascades to all owned resources
- Database deletion sets documents' databaseId to NULL
- Document deletion cascades to associated jobs

### Indexes
The schema relies on Prisma's automatic index generation for:
- Foreign key relationships
- Unique constraints
- Primary keys

## Business Logic

### Document Count Management
The `Database.documentCount` field is automatically maintained through:
- Increment on document creation
- Decrement on document deletion
- Manual recalculation via `DatabaseService.updateDocumentCount()`

### Job Lifecycle
Jobs track document processing with automatic timestamp management:
- `startDate` set on creation
- `endDate` set when status changes to FINISHED, FAILED, or CANCELLED
- `percentage` updated during processing

### User Settings
Default settings are created automatically for new users with sensible defaults:
- Light theme
- English language
- Notifications enabled
- Auto-save enabled

### Database Server Management
Servers track connection health:
- `isActive` indicates current availability
- `lastConnected` updated on successful connections
- Connection failures logged for troubleshooting

### Security Considerations
- API keys are stored as unique strings (should be hashed in production)
- Database passwords stored in plain text (should be encrypted in production)
- User roles control access to resources
- Foreign key constraints ensure data integrity

### Performance Considerations
- Document count is cached to avoid expensive COUNT queries
- Jobs are ordered by creation date for efficient pagination
- Indexes on foreign keys ensure fast relationship queries
- Soft deletion pattern used for documents (DELETED state)

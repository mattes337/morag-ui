# Task 1: Webhook vs Manual Trigger Evaluation

## Overview

Evaluate and decide between two approaches for stage execution:
1. **Automatic Processing with Webhooks**: Backend processes all stages automatically and notifies UI via webhooks
2. **Manual Stage Triggering**: UI triggers each stage individually via REST calls

## Problem Statement

We need to determine the optimal approach for stage execution that balances:
- User control and visibility
- System reliability and error handling
- Performance and scalability
- Development complexity

## Approach 1: Automatic Processing with Webhooks

### How it Works
1. User uploads document or triggers processing
2. Backend automatically executes all stages in sequence
3. Backend sends webhook notifications for each stage completion
4. UI receives webhooks and updates document status/files

### Pros
- **Simplified UI Logic**: Less complex state management
- **Automatic Processing**: No manual intervention required
- **Consistent Flow**: Standardized processing pipeline
- **Background Processing**: User doesn't need to wait

### Cons
- **Less Control**: User cannot pause or modify processing mid-flow
- **Webhook Infrastructure**: Requires reliable webhook handling
- **Error Recovery**: Harder to retry individual stages
- **Debugging**: Less visibility into individual stage issues

### Technical Requirements
- Webhook endpoint implementation (`/api/webhooks/stages`)
- Webhook authentication and validation
- Reliable webhook delivery and retry mechanisms
- UI state management for webhook updates
- Error handling for failed webhooks

## Approach 2: Manual Stage Triggering

### How it Works
1. User uploads document
2. UI displays available stages for the document
3. User triggers each stage individually via UI
4. UI calls REST endpoints for each stage
5. UI receives immediate response with stage output

### Pros
- **Full Control**: User can pause, retry, or skip stages
- **Better Debugging**: Clear visibility into each stage
- **Flexible Workflows**: Support for custom processing flows
- **Immediate Feedback**: Direct response from API calls

### Cons
- **Complex UI**: More state management and user interaction
- **Manual Process**: Requires user attention throughout
- **Potential Inconsistency**: Users might skip important stages
- **Performance**: Synchronous processing might be slower

### Technical Requirements
- Individual stage REST endpoints
- UI components for stage management
- Progress tracking and state persistence
- Error handling and retry mechanisms
- Stage dependency validation

## Hybrid Approach (Recommended)

### How it Works
1. **Default**: Automatic processing with webhook notifications
2. **Override**: Manual stage triggering when needed
3. **Flexibility**: Users can choose processing mode per document

### Benefits
- **Best of Both**: Automatic for normal use, manual for debugging
- **User Choice**: Different workflows for different needs
- **Gradual Migration**: Can start with one approach and add the other

### Implementation Strategy
1. Start with manual triggering for better control during development
2. Add webhook support once manual approach is stable
3. Provide UI toggle for processing mode selection

## Decision Criteria

### User Experience
- **Automatic**: Better for non-technical users
- **Manual**: Better for debugging and development
- **Hybrid**: Best overall user experience

### Development Complexity
- **Automatic**: Medium (webhook infrastructure)
- **Manual**: High (complex UI state management)
- **Hybrid**: High (both approaches)

### Reliability
- **Automatic**: Depends on webhook reliability
- **Manual**: More predictable, easier to debug
- **Hybrid**: Most reliable (fallback options)

### Performance
- **Automatic**: Better for batch processing
- **Manual**: Better for individual document control
- **Hybrid**: Optimal for different use cases

## Recommendation

**Start with Manual Triggering, Add Webhooks Later**

### Phase 1: Manual Implementation
1. Implement individual stage REST endpoints
2. Create UI components for stage visualization and control
3. Add progress tracking and error handling
4. Test and refine the manual approach

### Phase 2: Webhook Integration
1. Add webhook endpoints and handling
2. Implement automatic processing mode
3. Add UI toggle for processing mode selection
4. Provide migration path for existing documents

## Implementation Tasks

### Immediate (Phase 1)
- [ ] Design stage management UI components
- [ ] Implement REST endpoint calls for each stage
- [ ] Add progress tracking and state management
- [ ] Create error handling and retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add stage dependency validation

### Future (Phase 2)
- [ ] Design webhook endpoint structure
- [ ] Implement webhook authentication
- [ ] Add automatic processing mode
- [ ] Create processing mode selection UI
- [ ] Add webhook retry and error handling

## Success Criteria

1. **Stage Control**: Users can trigger individual stages manually
2. **Progress Visibility**: Clear indication of current processing stage
3. **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of stage failures with retry options
4. **File Management**: Proper storage and retrieval of stage output files
5. **Performance**: Acceptable response times for stage execution

## Risks and Mitigation

### Risk: Complex State Management
- **Mitigation**: Use established state management patterns (React Context/Redux)
- **Mitigation**: Implement comprehensive testing for state transitions

### Risk: Stage Dependencies
- **Mitigation**: Implement validation to prevent invalid stage sequences
- **Mitigation**: Clear UI indicators for stage prerequisites

### Risk: Error Recovery
- **Mitigation**: Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- **Mitigation**: Provide clear error messages and recovery suggestions

## Next Steps

1. **Review and Approve**: Get stakeholder approval for the recommended approach
2. **UI Design**: Create mockups for stage management interface
3. **API Design**: Define REST endpoint specifications
4. **Database Schema**: Plan storage for stage outputs and status
5. **Implementation**: Begin with core manual triggering functionality
